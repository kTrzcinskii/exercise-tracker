# exercise-tracker
Fullstack app which will help you keep track of your progress.

This site was created as a part of freeCodeCamp course.
It focuses on backend but I've decided to create a fullstack app to show a variety of skills I've learnt as a web dev.
You can find more about the requirements of this project [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker).
